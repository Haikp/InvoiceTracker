This was good practice for OOP in cpp, putting what I learned to practice. It's functionality at the moment is more of a to-do list with saves and what not, but it only works in the terminal for now. I would like to make some kind of usable front end thats more simple for older people to use.

I'm not sure of the quality of the code, I know its not great but its definitely better than my previous attempts at oop when I didn't consult any texts.

I'm sure that there are definitely better ways of implementing this invoice tracker idea, especially when I'm sure that the class invoice could practically be a struct that exists inside invoice_list, but I just wanted create something using the principles I saw when I read up on ray tracing. When I added private functions to invoice though, I think that could justify invoice being its own class, making it have its own identity and invoice_list be purely managing the list and not the contents.

My understand is definitely not where I want it to be, but atleast its better.

Edit: I think the best course of action is to port this code to javascript so that its easier for the intended audience. I made some more changes, and thought about how I should make the UI, and I think the best thing to do is to make it into a browser based UI. I'm not exactly excited to learn webasm just for this, and I think learning javascript would benefit me more anyways.

####EDIT
A javascript version of the project can be found (here)[https://github.com/Haikp/InvoiceTrackerJS]. This project was a request for me to make for someone, hence why I wanted something to make it easier for people who aren't the best with technology. This small project more or less serves as a way for me compare my oop fundamentals now to how it was before.
